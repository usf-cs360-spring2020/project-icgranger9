					 Peer Feedback
				</h1>

				<p>The feedback from my peers was generally positive, however there were a points of improvement that my peers pointed out. The first piece of helpful advice was "the map has a certain amount of lie factor because of missing labels which can be clearly covered up by interactivity". This was a huge issue with my initial prototypes, that it was unclear what country a viewer was looking at. Another piece of feedback that I got was "the visualization has a good start however the lie factor would be in the projected map as the world map would create more bias on a country that has a bigger size rather than on the actual color encoded value". Unfortunately, this is a known issue with chloroplath maps, and something that I was unable to do much about.</p>

				<h3>
					<!-- TODO: Change page title -->
					 Instructor Feedback
				</h3>

				<p>The feedback that I got from Sophie was extremely helpful. She suggested that instead of two types of filtering, which I had initially planned, that I use the additional details for another visualization. She had two different ideas on how to achieve this. The first was to have two completely separate visualizations, a map and a bar or line chart, with connected interactivity, so that clicking or hovering over a part of the map would update the bar chart. Her other suggestion was to have a secondary chart in the details on demand.</p>

				<h5>
					<!-- TODO: Change page title -->
					 Changes
				</h5>

				<p>Given the peer and instructor feedback, I knew there were details of my implementation that I needed to iron out. After the instructors feedback in particular, I had a direction to go. However, I was unsure of which suggestion was best. My initial inclination was to implement two completely separate visualizations, and link them with interactivity. However, after some basic prototyping I began to realize that this approach took up significant screen space, and in the end I decided it was too large. On the other hand, I initially had the opposite concern (that it would be too small), but in the end I think this turned out to be the best approach.</p>
